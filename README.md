continue hanging out with your friends, even though they're half-way around the world. Share videos, recipes, shopping, 
and anything else you want.

Project by Whitaker Cohen and Ashley Lorden as part of Hackbright Academy. Features OpenTok API for live video chat,
Pusher API to keep collaborative browser sharing in sync, and HTML5 PostMessage to get around iframe single source
security issues. Collaborative browser sharing works by installing coso.tamper.js file into a TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey
script to inject client.js onto pages visited. Feel free to provide improvements via pull request if you would like
to use Coso.
